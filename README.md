# JSONiq for Python users

This tutorial introduces JSONiq to Python users by directly comparing the languages.

What is presented here is not only the core JSONiq language, which is purely declarative and functional, but also its Update Facility extension, to modify JSON documents, as well as its Scripting extension, which supports imperative features such as variable assignment, side effects and while loops.
